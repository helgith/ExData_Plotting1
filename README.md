# ExData_Plotting1

This is a solution to Project1 exercise in Exploratory Data Analysis. It is based on the description in https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1.

This assignment uses data (<a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]) 
from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>. 
This dataset needs to be downloaded and uncompressed into the same directory as the code 
and the working directory set to this directory prior to execution from RStudio. 

The R Code only reads in the relevant data between 1/2/2007 and 2/2/2007. The weekdays are written in Germany (Do, Fr, Sa instead of Thu, Fri, Sat).
